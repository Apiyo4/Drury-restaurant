    <p>I went to <span>Drury</span> over the weekends for a quick lunch before our weekly meeting with the girls. I was quite impressed with the food quality and the timely manner in which it was prepared. I'd reccommend it to anyone, <em>Rossie</em>.</p>
    <p>I enjoy eatting <span>Drury's</span> mouthwatering fried chicken, expecially on a hot summer evening, <em>Sam.</em></p>
    <p>The crunchy tilapia taste makes it on the top spot favorite for my ten-year-old son, <em>Paul</em>.
